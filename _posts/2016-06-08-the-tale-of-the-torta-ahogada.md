  Don Ignacio "Nacho" Salda単a, 82, still gets up before sunrise every morning to
  prepare the food and man the counter at his restaurant, Tortas Ahogadas "El
  G端erito," open in Guadalajara's historic center since 1959. He tops his thin,
  closely cropped white hair with a blue baseball cap, his squinty eyes behind
  black metal-rimmed glasses resting on his broad nose.
