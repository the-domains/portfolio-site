  Every year in California thousands of parents choose names such as José,
  Andrés and Sofía for their children, often honoring the memory of a deceased
  grandmother, aunt or sibling. On the state-issued birth certificates, though,
  those names will be spelled incorrectly. California, like several other
  states, prohibits the use of diacritical marks or accents on official
  documents.
