      The scene backstage last November at the American Music Awards, that
      annual gathering of pop perennials and idiosyncratic arrivistes, was
      carnivalesque: Niall and Liam of One Direction toddled about trying to
      snap a picture with a selfie stick, while Zayn, their bandmate at the
      time, smoked coolly out of frame; Ne-Yo was there in a leopard-Â­print
      blazer two sizes too small; Lil Wayne was wandering around, alone, wearing
      absurd shoes.

  This is supposed to be a review about Stevie Wonder headlining the first night
  of the Life is Beautiful Festival in downtown Las Vegas, but as Yeezus himself
  will tell you, all roads lead back to Kanye West, and this is no different.
